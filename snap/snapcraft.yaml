title: cURL(with Metalink support)
summary: Download Metalinks with cURL for Debianish distros
description: |
  This snap ships a build of cURL with [Metalink][1] support to provide a *workaround* for Debianish GNU/Linux distribution where the feature is not enabled due to the missing packaging of libmetalink([Debian][2], [Ubuntu][3]).

  This snap does not guarantee to be up-to-date with upstream and free of security exploits, and is only recommended for downloading metalinks only.
